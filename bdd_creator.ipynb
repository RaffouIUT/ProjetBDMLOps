If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it would have been terrible.\\nEvery data structure I had ever used was built into the language, and I didn\\'t know how they worked\\nunder the hood at all. I never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an \"out of\\nmemory\" error, and then I\\'d have to find a workaround. I used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and\\nthousands of associative arrays, but I never created data structures from scratch.\\nIt\\'s a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\\n⬆ back to top\\nHow to use it\\nEverything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.\\nI\\'m using GitHub\\'s special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track progress.\\n  - More about GitHub-flavored markdown\\nIf you don\\'t want to use git\\nOn this page, click the Code button near the top, then click \"Download ZIP\". Unzip the file and you can work with the text files.\\nIf you\\'re open in a code editor that understands markdown, you\\'ll see everything formatted nicely.\\nIf you\\'re comfortable with git\\nCreate a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]\\nFork the GitHub repo: https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university by clicking on the Fork button.\\nClone to your local repo:\\nbash\\ngit clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/coding-interview-university.git\\ncd coding-interview-university\\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university.git\\ngit remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE  # so that you don\\'t push your personal progress back to the original repo\\nMark all boxes with X after you completed your changes:\\n```bash\\ngit commit -am \"Marked personal progress\"\\ngit pull upstream main  # keep your fork up-to-date with changes from the original repo\\ngit push # just pushes to your fork\\n```\\n⬆ back to top\\nDon\\'t feel you aren\\'t smart enough\\nSuccessful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren\\'t smart enough.\\nThe following videos may help you overcome this insecurity:\\nThe myth of the Genius Programmer\\nIt\\'s Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech\\n⬆ back to top\\nA Note About Video Resources\\nSome videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. These are called MOOCs.\\nSometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access.\\nIt would be great to replace the online course resources with free and always-available public sources,\\nsuch as YouTube videos (preferably university lectures), so that you people can study these anytime,\\nnot just when a specific online course is in session.\\n⬆ back to top\\nChoose a Programming Language\\nYou\\'ll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you do,\\nbut you\\'ll also need to find a language that you can use to study computer science concepts.\\nPreferably the language would be the same, so that you only need to be proficient in one.\\nFor this Study Plan\\nWhen I did the study plan, I used 2 languages for most of it: C and Python\\nC: Very low level. Allows you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures\\n    and algorithms in your bones. In higher-level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day-to-day work, that\\'s terrific,\\n    but when you\\'re learning how these low-level data structures are built, it\\'s great to feel close to the metal.\\nC is everywhere. You\\'ll see examples in books, lectures, videos, everywhere while you\\'re studying.\\nThe C Programming Language, 2nd Edition\\nThis is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little\\n    you\\'ll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.\\nYou don\\'t need to go super deep in the book (or even finish it). Just get to where you\\'re comfortable reading and writing in C.\\nPython: Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it\\'s just super useful and also allows me to write less code in an interview.\\nThis is my preference. You do what you like, of course.\\nYou may not need it, but here are some sites for learning a new language:\\n- Exercism\\n- Codewars\\n- HackerEarth\\n- Scaler Topics (Java, C++)\\n- Programiz PRO Community Challenges)\\nFor your Coding Interview\\nYou can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:\\nC++\\nJava\\nPython\\nYou could also use these, but read around first. There may be caveats:\\nJavaScript\\nRuby\\nHere is an article I wrote about choosing a language for the interview:\\nPick One Language for the Coding Interview.\\nThis is the original article my post was based on: Choosing a Programming Language for Interviews\\nYou need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.\\nRead more about choices:\\n- Choose the Right Language for Your Coding Interview\\nSee language-specific resources here\\n⬆ back to top\\nBooks for Data Structures and Algorithms\\nThis book will form your foundation for computer science.\\nJust choose one, in a language that you will be comfortable with.

And you\\'ll save months of time.\\n1. You Won\\'t Remember it All\\nI watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn\\'t remember. I spent 3 days going\\nthrough my notes and making flashcards, so I could review. I didn\\'t need all of that knowledge.\\nPlease, read so you won\\'t make my mistakes:\\nRetaining Computer Science Knowledge.\\n2. Use Flashcards\\nTo solve the problem, I made a little flashcard site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code.\\nEach card has a different formatting. I made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone or tablet, wherever I am.\\nMake your own for free:\\nFlashcards site repo\\nI DON\\'T RECOMMEND using my flashcards. There are too many and most of them are trivia that you don\\'t need.\\nBut if you don\\'t want to listen to me, here you go:\\n- My flash cards database (1200 cards):\\n- My flash cards database (extreme - 1800 cards):\\nKeep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics.\\nIt\\'s way too much for what\\'s required.\\nNote on flashcards: The first time you recognize you know the answer, don\\'t mark it as known. You have to see the\\nsame card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in\\nyour brain.\\nAn alternative to using my flashcard site is Anki, which has been recommended to me numerous times.\\nIt uses a repetition system to help you remember. It\\'s user-friendly, available on all platforms, and has a cloud sync system.\\nIt costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.\\nMy flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560 (thanks @xiewenya).\\nSome students have mentioned formatting issues with white space that can be fixed by doing the following: open the deck, edit the card, click cards, select the \"styling\" radio button, and add the member \"white-space: pre;\" to the card class.\\n3. Do Coding Interview Questions While You\\'re Learning\\nTHIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.\\nStart doing coding interview questions while you\\'re learning data structures and algorithms.\\nYou need to apply what you\\'re learning to solve problems, or you\\'ll forget. I made this mistake.\\nOnce you\\'ve learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for example, linked lists:\\n1. Open one of the coding interview books (or coding problem websites, listed below)\\n1. Do 2 or 3 questions regarding linked lists.\\n1. Move on to the next learning topic.\\n1. Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems.\\n1. Do this with each new topic you learn.\\nKeep doing problems while you\\'re learning all this stuff, not after.\\nYou\\'re not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the knowledge.\\nThere are many resources for this, listed below. Keep going.\\n4. Focus\\nThere are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard. Turn on some music\\nwithout lyrics and you\\'ll be able to focus pretty well.\\n⬆ back to top\\nWhat you won\\'t see covered\\nThese are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:\\nJavascript\\nHTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies\\nSQL\\n⬆ back to top\\nThe Daily Plan\\nThis course goes over a lot of subjects. Each will probably take you a few days, or maybe even a week or more. It depends on your schedule.\\nEach day, take the next subject in the list, watch some videos about that subject, and then write an implementation\\nof that data structure or algorithm in the language you chose for this course.\\nYou can see my code here:\\n - C\\n - C++\\n - Python\\nYou don\\'t need to memorize every algorithm. You just need to be able to understand it enough to be able to write your own implementation.\\n⬆ back to top\\nCoding Question Practice\\nWhy is this here? I\\'m not ready to interview.\\nThen go back and read this.\\nWhy you need to practice doing programming problems:\\n- Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in\\n- Gathering requirements for the problem\\n- Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview\\n- Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer\\n- Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions (see Big-O below)\\n- Testing your solutions\\nThere is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem-solving in an interview. You\\'ll get this from the programming\\ninterview books, too, but I found this outstanding:\\nAlgorithm design canvas\\nWrite code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then type it and test it out on a computer.\\nIf you don\\'t have a whiteboard at home, pick up a large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice.\\nThis is my \"sofa whiteboard\". I added the pen in the photo just for scale. If you use a pen, you\\'ll wish you could erase.\\nGets messy quickly.

From what I\\'ve read, you won\\'t implement a\\n    balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up\\n    and let\\'s face it, splay trees are the bee\\'s knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code\\nSplay tree: insert, search, delete functions\\nIf you end up implementing a red/black tree try just these:\\nSearch and insertion functions, skipping delete\\nI want to learn more about B-Tree since it\\'s used so widely with very large data sets\\nSelf-balancing binary search tree\\nAVL trees\\nIn practice:\\n    From what I can tell, these aren\\'t used much in practice, but I could see where they would be:\\n    The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly\\n    balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it\\n    attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language\\n    dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter)\\nMIT AVL Trees / AVL Sort (video)\\nAVL Trees (video)\\nAVL Tree Implementation (video)\\nSplit And Merge\\n[Review] AVL Trees (playlist) in 19 minutes (video)\\nSplay trees\\nIn practice:\\n    Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,\\n    data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,\\n    networking and file system code) etc\\nCS 61B: Splay Trees (video)\\nMIT Lecture: Splay Trees:\\nGets very mathy, but watch the last 10 minutes for sure.\\nVideo\\nRed/black trees\\nThese are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below).\\nIn practice:\\n    Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.\\n    Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,\\n    but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures that provide worst-case guarantees;\\n    for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red-black trees, and\\n    the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In version 8 of Java,\\n    the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor\\n    hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used\\nAduni - Algorithms - Lecture 4 (link jumps to the starting point) (video)\\nAduni - Algorithms - Lecture 5 (video)\\nRed-Black Tree\\nAn Introduction To Binary Search And Red Black Tree\\n[Review] Red-Black Trees (playlist) in 30 minutes (video)\\n2-3 search trees\\nIn practice:\\n    2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).\\nYou would use 2-3 trees very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red-Black trees.\\n23-Tree Intuition and Definition (video)\\nBinary View of 23-Tree\\n2-3 Trees (student recitation) (video)\\n2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)\\nIn practice:\\n    For every 2-4 trees, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion\\n    operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an\\n    important tool for understanding the logic behind red-black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce\\n    2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though 2-4 trees are not often used in practice.\\nCS 61B Lecture 26: Balanced Search Trees (video)\\nBottom Up 234-Trees (video)\\nTop Down 234-Trees (video)\\nN-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees\\nnote: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)\\nbinary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2\\n2-3 trees are 3-ary\\nK-Ary Tree\\nB-Trees\\nFun fact: it\\'s a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).\\nIn Practice:\\n    B-trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to\\n    its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary\\n    block in a particular file.

You are expected to lead it.\\nYou can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the System design interview questions with solutions section using the following steps.\\nStep 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions\\nGather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.\\nWho is going to use it?\\nHow are they going to use it?\\nHow many users are there?\\nWhat does the system do?\\nWhat are the inputs and outputs of the system?\\nHow much data do we expect to handle?\\nHow many requests per second do we expect?\\nWhat is the expected read to write ratio?\\nStep 2: Create a high level design\\nOutline a high level design with all important components.\\nSketch the main components and connections\\nJustify your ideas\\nStep 3: Design core components\\nDive into details for each core component.

Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.1\\nAnother way to look at performance vs scalability:\\nIf you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user.\\nIf you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nA word on scalability\\nScalability, availability, stability, patterns\\nLatency vs throughput\\nLatency is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.\\nThroughput is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.\\nGenerally, you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nUnderstanding latency vs throughput\\nAvailability vs consistency\\nCAP theorem\\nSource: CAP theorem revisited\\nIn a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:\\nConsistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error\\nAvailability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information\\nPartition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures\\nNetworks aren\\'t reliable, so you\\'ll need to support partition tolerance.  You\\'ll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.\\nCP - consistency and partition tolerance\\nWaiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.\\nAP - availability and partition tolerance\\nResponses return the most readily available version of the data available on any node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.\\nAP is a good choice if the business needs to allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nCAP theorem revisited\\nA plain english introduction to CAP theorem\\nCAP FAQ\\nThe CAP theorem\\nConsistency patterns\\nWith multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data.  Recall the definition of consistency from the CAP theorem - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\\nWeak consistency\\nAfter a write, reads may or may not see it.  A best effort approach is taken.\\nThis approach is seen in systems such as memcached.  Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games.  For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.\\nEventual consistency\\nAfter a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds).  Data is replicated asynchronously.\\nThis approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email.  Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.\\nStrong consistency\\nAfter a write, reads will see it.  Data is replicated synchronously.\\nThis approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes.  Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nTransactions across data centers\\nAvailability patterns\\nThere are two complementary patterns to support high availability: fail-over and replication.\\nFail-over\\nActive-passive\\nWith active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby.  If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active\\'s IP address and resumes service.\\nThe length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in \\'hot\\' standby or whether it needs to start up from \\'cold\\' standby.  Only the active server handles traffic.\\nActive-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.\\nActive-active\\nIn active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.\\nIf the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers.  If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.\\nActive-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.\\nDisadvantage(s): failover\\nFail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.\\nThere is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.\\nReplication\\nMaster-slave and master-master\\nThis topic is further discussed in the Database section:\\nMaster-slave replication\\nMaster-master replication\\nAvailability in numbers\\nAvailability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available.  Availability is generally measured in number of 9s--a service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s.\\n99.9% availability - three 9s\\n| Duration            | Acceptable downtime|\\n|---------------------|--------------------|\\n| Downtime per year   | 8h 45min 57s       |\\n| Downtime per month  | 43m 49.7s          |\\n| Downtime per week   | 10m 4.8s           |\\n| Downtime per day    | 1m 26.4s           |\\n99.99% availability - four 9s\\n| Duration            | Acceptable downtime|\\n|---------------------|--------------------|\\n| Downtime per year   | 52min 35.7s        |\\n| Downtime per month  | 4m 23s             |\\n| Downtime per week   | 1m 5s              |\\n| Downtime per day    | 8.6s               |\\nAvailability in parallel vs in sequence\\nIf a service consists of multiple components prone to failure, the service\\'s overall availability depends on whether the components are in sequence or in parallel.\\nIn sequence\\nOverall availability decreases when two components with availability < 100% are in sequence:\\nAvailability (Total) = Availability (Foo) * Availability (Bar)\\nIf both Foo and Bar each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in sequence would be 99.8%.\\nIn parallel\\nOverall availability increases when two components with availability < 100% are in parallel:\\nAvailability (Total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (Foo)) * (1 - Availability (Bar))\\nIf both Foo and Bar each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in parallel would be 99.9999%.\\nDomain name system\\nSource: DNS security presentation\\nA Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.\\nDNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level.  Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup.  Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays.  DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the time to live (TTL).\\nNS record (name server) - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.\\nMX record (mail exchange) - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.\\nA record (address) - Points a name to an IP address.\\nCNAME (canonical) - Points a name to another name or CNAME (example.com to www.example.com) or to an A record.\\nServices such as CloudFlare and Route 53 provide managed DNS services.  Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:\\nWeighted round robin\\nPrevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance\\nBalance between varying cluster sizes\\nA/B testing\\nLatency-based\\nGeolocation-based\\nDisadvantage(s): DNS\\nAccessing a DNS server introduces a slight delay, although mitigated by caching described above.\\nDNS server management could be complex and is generally managed by governments, ISPs, and large companies.\\nDNS services have recently come under DDoS attack, preventing users from accessing websites such as Twitter without knowing Twitter\\'s IP address(es).\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nDNS architecture\\nWikipedia\\nDNS articles\\nContent delivery network\\nSource: Why use a CDN\\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user.  Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon\\'s CloudFront support dynamic content.  The site\\'s DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.\\nServing content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:\\nUsers receive content from data centers close to them\\nYour servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills\\nPush CDNs\\nPush CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server.  You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.  You can configure when content expires and when it is updated.  Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.\\nSites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn\\'t often updated work well with push CDNs.  Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.\\nPull CDNs\\nPull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content.  You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN.  This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the CDN.\\nA time-to-live (TTL) determines how long content is cached.  Pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN, but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed.\\nSites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.\\nDisadvantage(s): CDN\\nCDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN.\\nContent might be stale if it is updated before the TTL expires it.\\nCDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nGlobally distributed content delivery\\nThe differences between push and pull CDNs\\nWikipedia\\nLoad balancer\\nSource: Scalable system design patterns\\nLoad balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases.  In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client.  Load balancers are effective at:\\nPreventing requests from going to unhealthy servers\\nPreventing overloading resources\\nHelping to eliminate a single point of failure\\nLoad balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.\\nAdditional benefits include:\\nSSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations\\nRemoves the need to install X.509 certificates on each server\\nSession persistence - Issue cookies and route a specific client\\'s requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions\\nTo protect against failures, it\\'s common to set up multiple load balancers, either in active-passive or active-active mode.\\nLoad balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:\\nRandom\\nLeast loaded\\nSession/cookies\\nRound robin or weighted round robin\\nLayer 4\\nLayer 7\\nLayer 4 load balancing\\nLayer 4 load balancers look at info at the transport layer to decide how to distribute requests.  Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet.  Layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server, performing Network Address Translation (NAT).\\nLayer 7 load balancing\\nLayer 7 load balancers look at the application layer to decide how to distribute requests.  This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies.  Layer 7 load balancers terminate network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server.  For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.\\nAt the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.\\nHorizontal scaling\\nLoad balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability.  Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called Vertical Scaling.  It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.\\nDisadvantage(s): horizontal scaling\\nScaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers\\nServers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures\\nSessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a database (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent cache (Redis, Memcached)\\nDownstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out\\nDisadvantage(s): load balancer\\nThe load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.\\nIntroducing a load balancer to help eliminate a single point of failure results in increased complexity.\\nA single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nNGINX architecture\\nHAProxy architecture guide\\nScalability\\nWikipedia\\nLayer 4 load balancing\\nLayer 7 load balancing\\nELB listener config\\nReverse proxy (web server)\\nSource: Wikipedia\\nA reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.  Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server\\'s response to the client.\\nAdditional benefits include:\\nIncreased security - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client\\nIncreased scalability and flexibility - Clients only see the reverse proxy\\'s IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration\\nSSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations\\nRemoves the need to install X.509 certificates on each server\\nCompression - Compress server responses\\nCaching - Return the response for cached requests\\nStatic content - Serve static content directly\\nHTML/CSS/JS\\nPhotos\\nVideos\\nEtc\\nLoad balancer vs reverse proxy\\nDeploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers.  Often, load balancers  route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.\\nReverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.\\nSolutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.\\nDisadvantage(s): reverse proxy\\nIntroducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.\\nA single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a failover) further increases complexity.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nReverse proxy vs load balancer\\nNGINX architecture\\nHAProxy architecture guide\\nWikipedia\\nApplication layer\\nSource: Intro to architecting systems for scale\\nSeparating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently.  Adding a new API results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers.  The single responsibility principle advocates for small and autonomous services that work together.  Small teams with small services can plan more aggressively for rapid growth.\\nWorkers in the application layer also help enable asynchronism.\\nMicroservices\\nRelated to this discussion are microservices, which can be described as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services.  Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. 1\\nPinterest, for example, could have the following microservices: user profile, follower, feed, search, photo upload, etc.\\nService Discovery\\nSystems such as Consul, Etcd, and Zookeeper can help services find each other by keeping track of registered names, addresses, and ports.  Health checks help verify service integrity and are often done using an HTTP endpoint.  Both Consul and Etcd have a built in key-value store that can be useful for storing config values and other shared data.\\nDisadvantage(s): application layer\\nAdding an application layer with loosely coupled services requires a different approach from an architectural, operations, and process viewpoint (vs a monolithic system).\\nMicroservices can add complexity in terms of deployments and operations.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nIntro to architecting systems for scale\\nCrack the system design interview\\nService oriented architecture\\nIntroduction to Zookeeper\\nHere\\'s what you need to know about building microservices\\nDatabase\\nSource: Scaling up to your first 10 million users\\nRelational database management system (RDBMS)\\nA relational database like SQL is a collection of data items organized in tables.\\nACID is a set of properties of relational database transactions.\\nAtomicity - Each transaction is all or nothing\\nConsistency - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another\\nIsolation - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially\\nDurability - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so\\nThere are many techniques to scale a relational database: master-slave replication, master-master replication, federation, sharding, denormalization, and SQL tuning.\\nMaster-slave replication\\nThe master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more slaves, which serve only reads.  Slaves can also replicate to additional slaves in a tree-like fashion.  If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned.\\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\\nDisadvantage(s): master-slave replication\\nAdditional logic is needed to promote a slave to a master.\\nSee Disadvantage(s): replication for points related to both master-slave and master-master.\\nMaster-master replication\\nBoth masters serve reads and writes and coordinate with each other on writes.  If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes.\\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\\nDisadvantage(s): master-master replication\\nYou\\'ll need a load balancer or you\\'ll need to make changes to your application logic to determine where to write.\\nMost master-master systems are either loosely consistent (violating ACID) or have increased write latency due to synchronization.\\nConflict resolution comes more into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.\\nSee Disadvantage(s): replication for points related to both master-slave and master-master.\\nDisadvantage(s): replication\\nThere is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.\\nWrites are replayed to the read replicas.  If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can\\'t do as many reads.\\nThe more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to greater replication lag.\\nOn some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.\\nReplication adds more hardware and additional complexity.\\nSource(s) and further reading: replication\\nScalability, availability, stability, patterns\\nMulti-master replication\\nFederation\\nSource: Scaling up to your first 10 million users\\nFederation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function.  For example, instead of a single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: forums, users, and products, resulting in less read and write traffic to each database and therefore less replication lag.  Smaller databases result in more data that can fit in memory, which in turn results in more cache hits due to improved cache locality.  With no single central master serializing writes you can write in parallel, increasing throughput.\\nDisadvantage(s): federation\\nFederation is not effective if your schema requires huge functions or tables.\\nYou\\'ll need to update your application logic to determine which database to read and write.\\nJoining data from two databases is more complex with a server link.\\nFederation adds more hardware and additional complexity.\\nSource(s) and further reading: federation\\nScaling up to your first 10 million users\\nSharding\\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\\nSharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data.  Taking a users database as an example, as the number of users increases, more shards are added to the cluster.\\nSimilar to the advantages of federation, sharding results in less read and write traffic, less replication, and more cache hits.  Index size is also reduced, which generally improves performance with faster queries.  If one shard goes down, the other shards are still operational, although you\\'ll want to add some form of replication to avoid data loss.  Like federation, there is no single central master serializing writes, allowing you to write in parallel with increased throughput.\\nCommon ways to shard a table of users is either through the user\\'s last name initial or the user\\'s geographic location.\\nDisadvantage(s): sharding\\nYou\\'ll need to update your application logic to work with shards, which could result in complex SQL queries.\\nData distribution can become lopsided in a shard.  For example, a set of power users on a shard could result in increased load to that shard compared to others.\\nRebalancing adds additional complexity.  A sharding function based on consistent hashing can reduce the amount of transferred data.\\nJoining data from multiple shards is more complex.\\nSharding adds more hardware and additional complexity.\\nSource(s) and further reading: sharding\\nThe coming of the shard\\nShard database architecture\\nConsistent hashing\\nDenormalization\\nDenormalization attempts to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance.  Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.  Some RDBMS such as PostgreSQL and Oracle support materialized views which handle the work of storing redundant information and keeping redundant copies consistent.\\nOnce data becomes distributed with techniques such as federation and sharding, managing joins across data centers further increases complexity.  Denormalization might circumvent the need for such complex joins.\\nIn most systems, reads can heavily outnumber writes 100:1 or even 1000:1.

Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code.  Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor eventual consistency.\\nBASE is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases.  In comparison with the CAP Theorem, BASE chooses availability over consistency.\\nBasically available - the system guarantees availability.\\nSoft state - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.\\nEventual consistency - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn\\'t receive input during that period.\\nIn addition to choosing between SQL or NoSQL, it is helpful to understand which type of NoSQL database best fits your use case(s).  We\\'ll review key-value stores, document stores, wide column stores, and graph databases in the next section.\\nKey-value store\\nAbstraction: hash table\\nA key-value store generally allows for O(1) reads and writes and is often backed by memory or SSD.  Data stores can maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of key ranges.  Key-value stores can allow for storing of metadata with a value.\\nKey-value stores provide high performance and are often used for simple data models or for rapidly-changing data, such as an in-memory cache layer.  Since they offer only a limited set of operations, complexity is shifted to the application layer if additional operations are needed.\\nA key-value store is the basis for more complex systems such as a document store, and in some cases, a graph database.\\nSource(s) and further reading: key-value store\\nKey-value database\\nDisadvantages of key-value stores\\nRedis architecture\\nMemcached architecture\\nDocument store\\nAbstraction: key-value store with documents stored as values\\nA document store is centered around documents (XML, JSON, binary, etc), where a document stores all information for a given object.  Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document itself.  Note, many key-value stores include features for working with a value\\'s metadata, blurring the lines between these two storage types.\\nBased on the underlying implementation, documents are organized by collections, tags, metadata, or directories.  Although documents can be organized or grouped together, documents may have fields that are completely different from each other.\\nSome document stores like MongoDB and CouchDB also provide a SQL-like language to perform complex queries.  DynamoDB supports both key-values and documents.\\nDocument stores provide high flexibility and are often used for working with occasionally changing data.\\nSource(s) and further reading: document store\\nDocument-oriented database\\nMongoDB architecture\\nCouchDB architecture\\nElasticsearch architecture\\nWide column store\\nSource: SQL & NoSQL, a brief history\\nAbstraction: nested map ColumnFamily<RowKey, Columns<ColKey, Value, Timestamp>>\\nA wide column store\\'s basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair).  A column can be grouped in column families (analogous to a SQL table).  Super column families further group column families.  You can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a row.  Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.\\nGoogle introduced Bigtable as the first wide column store, which influenced the open-source HBase often-used in the Hadoop ecosystem, and Cassandra from Facebook.  Stores such as BigTable, HBase, and Cassandra maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of selective key ranges.\\nWide column stores offer high availability and high scalability.  They are often used for very large data sets.\\nSource(s) and further reading: wide column store\\nSQL & NoSQL, a brief history\\nBigtable architecture\\nHBase architecture\\nCassandra architecture\\nGraph database\\nSource: Graph database\\nAbstraction: graph\\nIn a graph database, each node is a record and each arc is a relationship between two nodes.  Graph databases are optimized to represent complex relationships with many foreign keys or many-to-many relationships.\\nGraphs databases offer high performance for data models with complex relationships, such as a social network.  They are relatively new and are not yet widely-used; it might be more difficult to find development tools and resources.  Many graphs can only be accessed with REST APIs.\\nSource(s) and further reading: graph\\nGraph database\\nNeo4j\\nFlockDB\\nSource(s) and further reading: NoSQL\\nExplanation of base terminology\\nNoSQL databases a survey and decision guidance\\nScalability\\nIntroduction to NoSQL\\nNoSQL patterns\\nSQL or NoSQL\\nSource: Transitioning from RDBMS to NoSQL\\nReasons for SQL:\\nStructured data\\nStrict schema\\nRelational data\\nNeed for complex joins\\nTransactions\\nClear patterns for scaling\\nMore established: developers, community, code, tools, etc\\nLookups by index are very fast\\nReasons for NoSQL:\\nSemi-structured data\\nDynamic or flexible schema\\nNon-relational data\\nNo need for complex joins\\nStore many TB (or PB) of data\\nVery data intensive workload\\nVery high throughput for IOPS\\nSample data well-suited for NoSQL:\\nRapid ingest of clickstream and log data\\nLeaderboard or scoring data\\nTemporary data, such as a shopping cart\\nFrequently accessed (\\'hot\\') tables\\nMetadata/lookup tables\\nSource(s) and further reading: SQL or NoSQL\\nScaling up to your first 10 million users\\nSQL vs NoSQL differences\\nCache\\nSource: Scalable system design patterns\\nCaching improves page load times and can reduce the load on your servers and databases.  In this model, the dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution.\\nDatabases often benefit from a uniform distribution of reads and writes across its partitions.  Popular items can skew the distribution, causing bottlenecks.  Putting a cache in front of a database can help absorb uneven loads and spikes in traffic.\\nClient caching\\nCaches can be located on the client side (OS or browser), server side, or in a distinct cache layer.\\nCDN caching\\nCDNs are considered a type of cache.\\nWeb server caching\\nReverse proxies and caches such as Varnish can serve static and dynamic content directly.  Web servers can also cache requests, returning responses without having to contact application servers.\\nDatabase caching\\nYour database usually includes some level of caching in a default configuration, optimized for a generic use case.  Tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance.\\nApplication caching\\nIn-memory caches such as Memcached and Redis are key-value stores between your application and your data storage.  Since the data is held in RAM, it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk.  RAM is more limited than disk, so cache invalidation algorithms such as least recently used (LRU) can help invalidate \\'cold\\' entries and keep \\'hot\\' data in RAM.\\nRedis has the following additional features:\\nPersistence option\\nBuilt-in data structures such as sorted sets and lists\\nThere are multiple levels you can cache that fall into two general categories: database queries and objects:\\nRow level\\nQuery-level\\nFully-formed serializable objects\\nFully-rendered HTML\\nGenerally, you should try to avoid file-based caching, as it makes cloning and auto-scaling more difficult.\\nCaching at the database query level\\nWhenever you query the database, hash the query as a key and store the result to the cache.  This approach suffers from expiration issues:\\nHard to delete a cached result with complex queries\\nIf one piece of data changes such as a table cell, you need to delete all cached queries that might include the changed cell\\nCaching at the object level\\nSee your data as an object, similar to what you do with your application code.  Have your application assemble the dataset from the database into a class instance or a data structure(s):\\nRemove the object from cache if its underlying data has changed\\nAllows for asynchronous processing: workers assemble objects by consuming the latest cached object\\nSuggestions of what to cache:\\nUser sessions\\nFully rendered web pages\\nActivity streams\\nUser graph data\\nWhen to update the cache\\nSince you can only store a limited amount of data in cache, you\\'ll need to determine which cache update strategy works best for your use case.\\nCache-aside\\nSource: From cache to in-memory data grid\\nThe application is responsible for reading and writing from storage.  The cache does not interact with storage directly.  The application does the following:\\nLook for entry in cache, resulting in a cache miss\\nLoad entry from the database\\nAdd entry to cache\\nReturn entry\\npython\\ndef get_user(self, user_id):\\n    user = cache.get(\"user.{0}\", user_id)\\n    if user is None:\\n        user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}\", user_id)\\n        if user is not None:\\n            key = \"user.{0}\".format(user_id)\\n            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))\\n    return user\\nMemcached is generally used in this manner.\\nSubsequent reads of data added to cache are fast.  Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading.  Only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn\\'t requested.\\nDisadvantage(s): cache-aside\\nEach cache miss results in three trips, which can cause a noticeable delay.\\nData can become stale if it is updated in the database.  This issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through.\\nWhen a node fails, it is replaced by a new, empty node, increasing latency.\\nWrite-through\\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\\nThe application uses the cache as the main data store, reading and writing data to it, while the cache is responsible for reading and writing to the database:\\nApplication adds/updates entry in cache\\nCache synchronously writes entry to data store\\nReturn\\nApplication code:\\npython\\nset_user(12345, {\"foo\":\"bar\"})\\nCache code:\\npython\\ndef set_user(user_id, values):\\n    user = db.query(\"UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}\", user_id, values)\\n    cache.set(user_id, user)\\nWrite-through is a slow overall operation due to the write operation, but subsequent reads of just written data are fast.  Users are generally more tolerant of latency when updating data than reading data.  Data in the cache is not stale.\\nDisadvantage(s): write through\\nWhen a new node is created due to failure or scaling, the new node will not cache entries until the entry is updated in the database.  Cache-aside in conjunction with write through can mitigate this issue.\\nMost data written might never be read, which can be minimized with a TTL.\\nWrite-behind (write-back)\\nSource: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns\\nIn write-behind, the application does the following:\\nAdd/update entry in cache\\nAsynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance\\nDisadvantage(s): write-behind\\nThere could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store.\\nIt is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through.\\nRefresh-ahead\\nSource: From cache to in-memory data grid\\nYou can configure the cache to automatically refresh any recently accessed cache entry prior to its expiration.\\nRefresh-ahead can result in reduced latency vs read-through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future.\\nDisadvantage(s): refresh-ahead\\nNot accurately predicting which items are likely to be needed in the future can result in reduced performance than without refresh-ahead.\\nDisadvantage(s): cache\\nNeed to maintain consistency between caches and the source of truth such as the database through cache invalidation.\\nCache invalidation is a difficult problem, there is additional complexity associated with when to update the cache.\\nNeed to make application changes such as adding Redis or memcached.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nFrom cache to in-memory data grid\\nScalable system design patterns\\nIntroduction to architecting systems for scale\\nScalability, availability, stability, patterns\\nScalability\\nAWS ElastiCache strategies\\nWikipedia\\nAsynchronism\\nSource: Intro to architecting systems for scale\\nAsynchronous workflows help reduce request times for expensive operations that would otherwise be performed in-line.  They can also help by doing time-consuming work in advance, such as periodic aggregation of data.\\nMessage queues\\nMessage queues receive, hold, and deliver messages.  If an operation is too slow to perform inline, you can use a message queue with the following workflow:\\nAn application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status\\nA worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete\\nThe user is not blocked and the job is processed in the background.  During this time, the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed.  For example, if posting a tweet, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers.\\nRedis is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost.\\nRabbitMQ is popular but requires you to adapt to the \\'AMQP\\' protocol and manage your own nodes.\\nAmazon SQS is hosted but can have high latency and has the possibility of messages being delivered twice.\\nTask queues\\nTasks queues receive tasks and their related data, runs them, then delivers their results.  They can support scheduling and can be used to run computationally-intensive jobs in the background.\\nCelery has support for scheduling and primarily has python support.\\nBack pressure\\nIf queues start to grow significantly, the queue size can become larger than memory, resulting in cache misses, disk reads, and even slower performance.  Back pressure can help by limiting the queue size, thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue.  Once the queue fills up, clients get a server busy or HTTP 503 status code to try again later.  Clients can retry the request at a later time, perhaps with exponential backoff.\\nDisadvantage(s): asynchronism\\nUse cases such as inexpensive calculations and realtime workflows might be better suited for synchronous operations, as introducing queues can add delays and complexity.\\nSource(s) and further reading\\nIt\\'s all a numbers game\\nApplying back pressure when overloaded\\nLittle\\'s law\\nWhat is the difference between a message queue and a task queue?\\nCommunication\\nSource: OSI 7 layer model\\nHypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)\\nHTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server.  It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request.  HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.\\nA basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint).  Below are common HTTP verbs:\\n| Verb | Description | Idempotent* | Safe | Cacheable |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| GET | Reads a resource | Yes | Yes | Yes |\\n| POST | Creates a resource or trigger a process that handles data | No | No | Yes if response contains freshness info |\\n| PUT | Creates or replace a resource | Yes | No | No |\\n| PATCH | Partially updates a resource | No | No | Yes if response contains freshness info |\\n| DELETE | Deletes a resource | Yes | No | No |\\n*Can be called many times without different outcomes.\\nHTTP is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as TCP and UDP.\\nSource(s) and further reading: HTTP\\nWhat is HTTP?\\nDifference between HTTP and TCP\\nDifference between PUT and PATCH\\nTransmission control protocol (TCP)\\nSource: How to make a multiplayer game\\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an IP network.  Connection is established and terminated using a handshake.  All packets sent are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through:\\nSequence numbers and checksum fields for each packet\\nAcknowledgement packets and automatic retransmission\\nIf the sender does not receive a correct response, it will resend the packets.  If there are multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped.  TCP also implements flow control and congestion control.  These guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than UDP.\\nTo ensure high throughput, web servers can keep a large number of TCP connections open, resulting in high memory usage.  It can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say, a memcached server.  Connection pooling can help in addition to switching to UDP where applicable.\\nTCP is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical.  Some examples include web servers, database info, SMTP, FTP, and SSH.\\nUse TCP over UDP when:\\nYou need all of the data to arrive intact\\nYou want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput\\nUser datagram protocol (UDP)\\nSource: How to make a multiplayer game\\nUDP is connectionless.  Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level.  Datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all.  UDP does not support congestion control.  Without the guarantees that TCP support, UDP is generally more efficient.\\nUDP can broadcast, sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet.  This is useful with DHCP because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.\\nUDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games.\\nUse UDP over TCP when:\\nYou need the lowest latency\\nLate data is worse than loss of data\\nYou want to implement your own error correction\\nSource(s) and further reading: TCP and UDP\\nNetworking for game programming\\nKey differences between TCP and UDP protocols\\nDifference between TCP and UDP\\nTransmission control protocol\\nUser datagram protocol\\nScaling memcache at Facebook\\nRemote procedure call (RPC)\\nSource: Crack the system design interview\\nIn an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server.  The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program.  Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls.  Popular RPC frameworks include Protobuf, Thrift, and Avro.\\nRPC is a request-response protocol:\\nClient program - Calls the client stub procedure.  The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.\\nClient stub procedure - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.\\nClient communication module - OS sends the message from the client to the server.\\nServer communication module - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.\\nServer stub procedure -  Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.\\nThe server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.\\nSample RPC calls:\\n```\\nGET /someoperation?data=anId\\nPOST /anotheroperation\\n{\\n  \"data\":\"anId\";\\n  \"anotherdata\": \"another value\"\\n}\\n```\\nRPC is focused on exposing behaviors.  RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.\\nChoose a native library (aka SDK) when:\\nYou know your target platform.\\nYou want to control how your \"logic\" is accessed.\\nYou want to control how error control happens off your library.\\nPerformance and end user experience is your primary concern.\\nHTTP APIs following REST tend to be used more often for public APIs.\\nDisadvantage(s): RPC\\nRPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.\\nA new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.\\nIt can be difficult to debug RPC.\\nYou might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box.  For example, it might require additional effort to ensure RPC calls are properly cached on caching servers such as Squid.\\nRepresentational state transfer (REST)\\nREST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server.  The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources.  All communication must be stateless and cacheable.\\nThere are four qualities of a RESTful interface:\\nIdentify resources (URI in HTTP) - use the same URI regardless of any operation.\\nChange with representations (Verbs in HTTP) - use verbs, headers, and body.\\nSelf-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP) - Use status codes, don\\'t reinvent the wheel.\\nHATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP) - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.\\nSample REST calls:\\n```\\nGET /someresources/anId\\nPUT /someresources/anId\\n{\"anotherdata\": \"another value\"}\\n```\\nREST is focused on exposing data.  It minimizes the coupling between client/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs.  REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, representation through headers, and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.  Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning.\\nDisadvantage(s): REST\\nWith REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy.  For example, returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path.  With REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body.\\nREST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) which sometimes doesn\\'t fit your use case.  For example, moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs.\\nFetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client and server to render single views, e.g. fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry. For mobile applications operating in variable network conditions, these multiple roundtrips are highly undesirable.\\nOver time, more fields might be added to an API response and older clients will receive all new data fields, even those that they do not need, as a result, it bloats the payload size and leads to larger latencies.\\nRPC and REST calls comparison\\n| Operation | RPC | REST |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Signup    | POST /signup | POST /persons |\\n| Resign    | POST /resign{\"personid\": \"1234\"} | DELETE /persons/1234 |\\n| Read a person | GET /readPerson?personid=1234 | GET /persons/1234 |\\n| Read a person’s items list | GET /readUsersItemsList?personid=1234 | GET /persons/1234/items |\\n| Add an item to a person’s items | POST /addItemToUsersItemsList{\"personid\": \"1234\";\"itemid\": \"456\"} | POST /persons/1234/items{\"itemid\": \"456\"} |\\n| Update an item    | POST /modifyItem{\"itemid\": \"456\";\"key\": \"value\"} | PUT /items/456{\"key\": \"value\"} |\\n| Delete an item | POST /removeItem{\"itemid\": \"456\"} | DELETE /items/456 |\\nSource: Do you really know why you prefer REST over RPC\\nSource(s) and further reading: REST and RPC\\nDo you really know why you prefer REST over RPC\\nWhen are RPC-ish approaches more appropriate than REST?\\nREST vs JSON-RPC\\nDebunking the myths of RPC and REST\\nWhat are the drawbacks of using REST\\nCrack the system design interview\\nThrift\\nWhy REST for internal use and not RPC\\nSecurity\\nThis section could use some updates.

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\\nComponent-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.\\nLearn Once, Write Anywhere: We don\\'t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.\\nLearn how to use React in your project.\\nInstallation\\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:\\nUse Quick Start to get a taste of React.\\nAdd React to an Existing Project to use as little or as much React as you need.\\nCreate a New React App if you\\'re looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.\\nDocumentation\\nYou can find the React documentation on the website.\\nCheck out the Getting Started page for a quick overview.\\nThe documentation is divided into several sections:\\nQuick Start\\nTutorial\\nThinking in React\\nInstallation\\nDescribing the UI\\nAdding Interactivity\\nManaging State\\nAdvanced Guides\\nAPI Reference\\nWhere to Get Support\\nContributing Guide\\nYou can improve it by sending pull requests to this repository.\\nExamples\\nWe have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:\\n```jsx\\nimport { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';\\nfunction HelloMessage({ name }) {\\n  return Hello {name};\\n}\\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\\'container\\'));\\nroot.render();\\n```\\nThis example will render \"Hello Taylor\" into a container on the page.\\nYou\\'ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.\\nContributing\\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.\\nCode of Conduct\\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\\nContributing Guide\\nRead our contributing guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.\\nGood First Issues\\nTo help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope.
